# match-game

This code implements the classic [Matching game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_game). 

The frontend is deployed as a static site for HTML, javascript, and images. The backend API is called to obtain the shuffled card deck. The card deck information is stored in a flat JSON file in order to avoid implementing an actual database.
